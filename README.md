  - The 7th is marked by the Day of the Paleontologist, which honors the professional who is dedicated to paleontology, a science that presents fossils as an object of study. Paleontologist's Day is celebrated on the same day as the foundation of the Brazilian Society of Paleontology (SBP). SBP was founded on March 7, 1958 and has its headquarters and venue in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

  - Right after that, we have the International Women's Day, on the 8th, a date that represents the struggle for equal pay for men and women, in addition to the fight against machismo and violence against women. It is a time when society must reflect and rethink attitudes, respecting and valuing women.

  - Then, on the 10th, Telephone Day is celebrated. The date was created as a way to honor the historic moment when Graham Bell managed to make the first electrical voice transmission in 1876.
